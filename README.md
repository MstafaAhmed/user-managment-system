This project is a great starting point for my learning C#.
The User Management System is a simple C# console application that allows users to add, remove, search, and display users.
It provides a basic user database using an array-based storage system with a maximum capacity of 100 users.
Features:
 Add User – Users can enter a name, age, ID, and address to create a new user.
 Remove User – Users can delete a user by entering their ID.
 Display Users – Shows a list of all registered users with their details.
 Search User – Allows searching for a user by their ID.
 Validation – Prevents duplicate IDs and ensures the array does not exceed its limit.
  
The program starts with a menu offering different user management options.
Users can enter their choices and interact with the system through the console.
The system checks for valid inputs and provides feedback accordingly.
Data is stored in an array (instead of a database or list), making it a simple, lightweight solution.
